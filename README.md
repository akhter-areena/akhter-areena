## Welcome! I'm Areena Akhter (she/her). :woman_technologist:
**I'm a computer science student in my last year the University of Waterloo, with a passion for understanding how, and why, we think the way that we do.**

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on:** studying neural networks, approaches to cognitive science, and why technology was inherently built **against** the interests of underrepresented populations in my 4A term of Computer Science.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning about:** how technologies have influenced human psychology and behaviour, the ethics of technology and its impacts on marginalized groups, and how to use React and external APIs to solve my everyday problems with software.

ðŸ‘¯ **I'm currently having fun with:** working out! I love rhythmic cycling, lifting weights, and running (currently training for my first half marathon!). I'm also passionate about getting back into writing, making art out of everyday experiences, fashion and style, and travelling and experiencing ways of life in new cities.
